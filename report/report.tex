In object detection tasks, ground truth bounding boxes assist in determining the accuracy of a detection algorithm, and help to visualise how it performs.
Figure \ref{fig:face} displays six images, with their ground truth bounding boxes in red, and the faces detected by \texttt{face.cpp}, which implements the Viola-Jones object detection framework, in green.

For the Viola-Jones frontal face detector, implemented in \texttt{face.cpp}, the ground

In an object detection task, the true positive rate (TPR) is the probability that an object will be positively detected.
However, the first practical difficulty that arises in calculating the TPR is whether or not to define a predicted bounding box as a being a true positive or a false positive.
I opted to define a detected bounding box as being a true positive if it had an intersection-over-union (IoU) value greater than 0.5 with a ground truth bounding box, as this is considered a good score \cite{iou}.
Moreover, for each ground truth bounding box, I only defined the detected bounding box with the largest IoU value as being a true positive if there was more than one intersecting detected bounding box.

In any detection task, TPR can be a flawed metric to use to define how well a given model performs.
This is because, it is possible to achieve a TPR of 100\% by detecting every possible pixel region as being the object being detected, despite having a large number of false positives.
As a result of this, the F\textsubscript{1} score is often used as a measure of a model's accuracy.
F\textsubscript{1} score is the harmonic mean of sensitivity (i.e. TPR) and precision.
Table \ref{tab:face} displays the F\textsubscript{1} score and TPR that `face.cpp' achieved on each of the \texttt{NoEntry\textasteriskcentered.jpg} images

Table \ref{tab:shape} displays the TPR and F\textsubscript{1} score of this implementation, as well as the difference compared with the Viola-Jones implementation.
The key merits and shortcomings include:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0em 
\item A vastly improved F\textsubscript{1} score, as a result of only defining no entry signs detected by the Viola-Jones detector as positive if accompanied by a corresponding circle in the circle Hough transform
\item No real improvement to the TPR score, as essentially no extra no entry signs can be detected due to the algorithm used to integrate the two detectors
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detection pipeline}

Figure \ref{fig:flow} outlines the way I combined evidence in my algorithm.
The rationale behind this was as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0em 
\item The Viola-Jones detector detected approximately 40\% of no entry signs, but had a large number of false positives
\item Upon inspection of the detected bounding boxes, it became clear the Viola-Jones detector appeared to be detecting regions with a light bar horizontally between two dark bars
\item Since no entry signs are circles, we could choose to detect the circles from the circle Hough transform that have an IoU with a Viola-Jones bounding box of greater than 50\%
\end{itemize}
